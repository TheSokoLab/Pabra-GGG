# Defines the standard FFS interfaces for a reaction
# coordinate between 0.0 and 1.0
# 
# 1st number is no. of steps between FFS checks
# 2nd number is no_interfaces
#
# This is followed by a list of interfaces consisting
# of two numbers:
#
# - The first is the value of the reaction
# coordinate at which interfaces are located.
#
# - The second indicates whether crossing this
# interface from above (+1), below (-1) or both
# directions (0) results in an interrupt of the
# current simulation.
