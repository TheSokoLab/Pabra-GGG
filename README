******************************************************

This scientific software was developed as part of a 
research project that started at FOM Institute AMOLF
in Amsterdam and later continued at IST Austria and
the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies.

By wrapping the generic "Pabra" toolkit that imple-
ments Non-Stationary Forward Flux Sampling (NS-FFS)
around the "Gap Gene Gillespie" (GGG) software for
spatial-stochastic simulation of mutually regulating
gene expression domains, it allows for enhanced
sampling of low-probability events in biochemical
systems driving embryonic development.

Pabra is implemented in Python, while GGG is written
in C++. This required to opt for an implementation
in which Pabra runs GGG for short time intervals
(typically 60s) and then collects the GGG output
for computing the relevant progress/reaction coor-
dinates. Pabra then assesses whether these have
crossed predefinable interfaces in reaction coordinate
space and "branches" the trajectories with different
seeds in order to enhance the probability of reaching
the subsequent interfaces. The branched trajectories
are reweighted according to the NS-FFS scheme in
order to obtain their actual unbiased probabilities.

While GGG in principle allows simulating arbitrary
reaction networks and initial spatial conditions in
cylindrical geometries, this package implements a
prototypical system in which 4 gene expression domains
are arranged in 5 stripes along the cylinder. In this 
geometry, which is inspired by the gap gene system in 
the early fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) embryo,
the next-nearest neighbor gene expression domains 
mutually repress each other strongly, while adjacent 
expression domains mutually repress with a weaker 
repression strength.

The repression strength can be systematically varied
via the preimplemented bash start script (START.sh).
In the script, also the parameters relevant to Pabra
can be tuned, such as the total length of the time
interval (histogram) simulated, number of bins, and
overall simulated time of all trajectories accumulated.
It is advisable to work with values here that are
multiples of half-hours. More information can be
found in the comments inside the start script.

Files with relaxed initial conditions for the five
stripe systems with pinned and unpinned boundary
conditions are already provided with the package.
These initial conditions were generated using GGG,
starting from perfectly rectangular equally spaced
profiles.

After the simulations terminate, the output directory
still contains the temporal subdirectories generated
when new schools were branched off. These should be
archived or discarded as needed.

The package also contains two custom analysis scripts
which are designed to analyse and visualize the
temporal and phase-space behavior of the reaction
progress coordinates, and for generating histograms
of the sampled branched progress trees.

See files analyse_tree.sh and dump_tree.py for more
information.

Pabra relies on using HDF5 tree structures for
storing the branched reaction trajectories and
thus requires the h5tree package. If not already
available on the specific system used, the package
can be conveniently installed via pip, using the
command 'pip install h5tree'.
